#TODO Create a function that takes a turtle as its parameter and gives that turtle (apple)
# a new location on the tree, only if the list of letters is not empty. 

#TODO Create a function that draws a new letter from the letter list.

#TODO Create a function that takes a turtle (apple) as its parameter
# and set that turtle to be shaped by the image file, call the letter drawing function,
# and update the Screen

#TODO Iterate over the numbers from 0 to the number of apples, creating that many turtles
# calling your function that resets the apples by giving them a new random location
# add the new apples to a list of apples to be used in the rest of the program.
# The loop below executes the correct number of times by using the range() function
# to create a list of numbers to iterate over.
# for i in range(0, number_of_apples):
  #Your code here

#TODO Create a function that takes a letter as its parameter, retrieve a
# random turtle (apple) and causes the turtle (apple) to drop from the tree and the letter 
# to disappear. Call the apple reseting function.

#TODO define a function per letter that you will use in your program. Each function should check
# to see if the given letter is in the list of letters; if it is, it should drop an apple at random.

#TODO use the onkeypress method of wn to correlate the functions you defined above with each
# of the letters that the user might type.
# onkeypress requires that you name one function that must take
# no arguments to be called when the specified key is pressed.
